# SchoolManagementSystem

## A school management system which uses an SQL database to store students and faculty of a school district. Each type of user gets a seperate dashboard wiht functionality useful for each user type.

### Currently have a working login screen which taken you to the proper menu based on type of account (admin, teacher, student)
### Allows admin users to add new members to the database which then can be used to login
### Need to add functionality to the Teacher and Student dashboards (view/edit grades, add/drop classes, etc.)
